## What's FASTBIN-ATTACK?  
In fact, fastbin-attack is just a general name that attack with fastbin.  
Therefore, the skill I will talk about this time is so similar to UAF.  
But, this attack can even write into arbitrary address!!:fire:

### Double Free
To get into this chapter, we should learn how double free happen first.  
```C
malloc(0x30); //rax = 0xA
malloc(0x30); //rax = 0xB
free(0xA);
free(0xB);
free(0xA);
```  
This time, you must confused that why glibc not find we free 0xA for two times?  
It's is because it just check the first one in the free list, so isn't it easy for us to bypass the check~
