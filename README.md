## I will learn exploitation of heap and introduce it with CTF example :smirk: Â 
  
### Vulnerability  
Most of heap exploitation are based on the careless machinism of ptmalloc.  
1. inuse(): only use the prev_use flag of next chunk to check whether the current chunk is allocated or not.  
2. prev_chunk(): only use prev_size to get the header of previous chunk.  
3. next_chunk(): only use **header + size** of current chunk to get the next header.  
4. chunksize: only check the size of current chunk.  
  
### Exploitation  
1. **UAF** [Enjoy the dir of UAF]  
2. **Unsafe unlink**
3. **Fastbin Corruption** [Enjoy the dir of fastbinattack]  
4. **House of Force** [Enjoy the dir of House Of Force]
5. **Unsorted bin Attack** [Enjoy the dir of Unsorted-bin-attack] 
6. **Off By One** [Enjoy the dir of Off-By-One]
