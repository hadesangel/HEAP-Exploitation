### Use After Free
There exists a dangling ptr that we use the same chunk after free().  
We always can see the example in two function ptr in two structure.  

```C
struct stu  
{  
  long stu_id;  
  name[8];
}
struct hi  
{  
  void (*playwithme)();  
  void (*please)();  
  char ok[8];  
}
```
The following is an important example for dangling ptr.Assume that **p is the ptr of hi** then we free(p).Second, we malloc a same size of stu as hi, they will use the same chunk because reason of **fastbin**. However, the data in hi **won't clean up** by free(), so if we store 0xdeadbeef in stuid, we will hijack the function ptr that *p.playwithme() -> 0xdeadbeef*
